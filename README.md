# Chat

ToDo


To enable communication between two instances of your chat application running on different computers, you'll need to implement some form of networking. Here's a basic outline of how you could achieve this:

- Choose a Networking Protocol: Decide on a networking protocol to use for communication between the client instances. This could be TCP/IP, UDP, WebSockets, etc. Each has its own advantages and considerations.

- Implement Client-Server Architecture: Designate one instance of your application as the server and the others as clients. The server will be responsible for relaying messages between clients.

- Networking Library: Choose a networking library that supports your chosen protocol and is compatible with C++ and your target platforms. Popular options include Boost.Asio for TCP/IP, SFML for TCP/IP and UDP, and WebSocket++ for WebSocket communication.

- Message Format: Define a message format that both the client and server will use to communicate. This should include information like the sender's ID, timestamp, and the actual message content.

- Client Implementation: Implement the client side of the communication protocol in your chat application. This involves establishing a connection to the server, sending messages, and receiving messages from other clients via the server.

- Server Implementation: Implement the server side of the communication protocol. The server will listen for incoming connections from clients, relay messages between clients, and manage the overall communication process.

- User Interface Integration: Integrate the networking functionality into your ImGui-based user interface. This could involve adding UI elements for entering server IP addresses, displaying connection status, and sending/receiving messages.

- Testing and Debugging: Thoroughly test your application to ensure that messages are being sent and received correctly, and that the networking functionality behaves as expected. Debug any issues that arise during testing.

- Deployment: Deploy your application to the target computers and ensure that they can communicate with each other over the network.

- Remember to consider security considerations such as authentication, encryption, and data validation to protect against unauthorized access and data manipulation. Additionally, handle network errors and edge cases gracefully to ensure a smooth user experience.
